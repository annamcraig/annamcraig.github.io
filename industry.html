                            <h3 class="date">Summer 2019</h3>
                            <p>I served as a biotechnology associate intern within the E. coli diagnostics development team for the Global Good Fund
                                at Intellectual Ventures. To increase the long-term stability of bacteriophages for device field testing and use, 
                                I developed a study that evaluated the impact of the addition of additives to the stability of bacteriophage in liquid 
                                over eight weeks. Throughout the project, I designed a liquid assay assessment to measure bacteriophage reporter ouput, to
                                be analyzed via excel, and conducted titer experiments as a secondary assessment. In addition, I presented research 
                                results to senior scientists, managers and directors to support product development in the company.
