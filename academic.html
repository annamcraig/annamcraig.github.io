            <h2>Relataional Database for a Movie Review App</h2>

                <img class='proj-screenshots' src='img/erd.png' alt='Screenshot of Movie Reccomender ERD'> 
                <p>As apart of my Relational Database Management course in the Informatics department at the University of Washington, I prototyped a database for a Movie Review App. Alongside my team, I drafted the ERD, revised the ERD to a normalized form using ACID base principles, and implemented the database using SQL. Additionally, we added constraints such as the age of a user, how many reviews a user could leave for a given movie, etc. Finally we populated the database and used visualization tools such as Tableau to show the value of our computed columns.

            <h2>Target Malaria: Mosquito Classification Device</h2>
            <p class="date">Winter 2020 - Spring 2020</p>  
            <section class='inline'>
                <p>For my senior capstone in the Bioengineering department at the University of Washington,  I prototyped a 
                Mosquito Classification Device for <a href="https://targetmalaria.org" target="_blank">Target Malaria</a>, a not for profit consortium that hopes to control the spread of malaria 
                via the implementation of a gene drive. The project consisted of two components, a heating device to run the LAMP assay and an 
                imaging device to record and analyze the results. Towards this, I developed an effective heating element using <i>SOLIDWORKS</i> with
                circuitry built via TinkerCad. The quality of the heat distribution was evaluated through a multitude of modeling completed in <i>COMSOL</i>. 
                This results of this project were presented at a professional project symposium.

                <p>As the Bioengineering curriculum and faculty at the University of Washington can at times seem daunting to students, 
                    a clear need in the department was a website by students for students. For my Departmental Honors Project, 
                    my team team sought to address this need by designing a website containing bioengineering course reccomendations and 
                    professor profiles. In doing so, we conducted various surveys to gain the feedback of my peers, interviewed core 
                    faculty members, and effectively displayed information on the website, supported by <i>Wix</i>. Partnering with faculty and 
                    academic advisors, Honors students in the coming year will guide the next iteration of the website to expand the scope of 
                    courses included.

            <p class="date">Winter 2020</p>
            <section class='inline'>
                <p>Over the course of my <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/20wi/" target="_blank">Data Structures and Algorithms</a> class at the UW, 
                    I built HuskyMaps, a navigation tool 
                    for University of Washington and regions surrounding it. Internally with <i>Java</i>, I implemented A* Search 
                    algorithms for path finding, an Autocomplete framework for search bar text suggestions, and used data 
                    structures such as k-d Trees and Deques for algorithm efficiency.

                <p>Within my second programming course, <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143/20wi/" target="_blank">CSE 143</a>,
                    at the University of Washington, I had the opportunity to build a game of 20 Questions in which a client plays the computer in 
                    a guessing game. Throughout this program, I was able to enhance my skills in both binary trees as well as recursion.

            <h2>Temperature Cooling Cuffs</h2>

            <section class='inline'>
                <p>Neonatal Asphyxia is extremely common in low resource settings resulting in mortality rates of 68.82 deaths per 100,00
                    as well as long-term disabilities. In an Engineering Design course, myself alongside a team of my peers were able
                    to address this by designing hypothermia inducing cooling cuffs, a portable, cost-effective method to reduce cerebral metabolism
                    inhibit caspase enzymes and suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukins. <i>COMSOL</i> modeling was 
                    completed to ensure the cuffs were capable of inducing hypothermia.

            <h2>Thermostat PID Controlled - Tropical Fish Tank</h2>
            <p class="date">Winter 2019</p>
            <section class='inline'>
                <img class='proj-screenshots' src='img/pid.png' alt='PID controller diagram'> 
                <p>Fish are ectotherms that rely on their environment to control their temperature, that is their body temperature varies 
                    directly with water temperature. Thus, heating and temperature control are necessities for many species of aquarium fish.  
                    In my Mass Transport and Systems course at the UW, I developed a PID controlled thermostat using <i>LabView</i> simulations and basic circuitry along 
                    with my peers. The group was able to achieve an extremely accurate controlled with maximum fluctuations from the setpoint within 0.7 degrees C, 
                    by tuning the PID parameters.
