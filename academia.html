                            <h3 class="date">Winter 2020 - Spring 2020</h3>
                            <p>For my senior capstone in the Bioengineering department at the Uniersity of Washington,  I prototyped a 
                                Mosquito Classification Device for <a href="https://targetmalaria.org" target="_blank">Target Malaria</a>, a not for profit consortium that hopes to control the spread of malaria 
                                via the implementation of a gene drive. The project consisted of two components, a heating device to run the LAMP assay and an 
                                imaging device to record and analyze the results. Towards this, I developed an effective heating element using <i>SOLIDWORKS</i> with
                                circuitry built via TinkerCad. The quality of the heat distribution was evaluated through a multitude of modeling completed in <i>COMSOL</i>. 
                                This results of this project were presented at a professional project symposium.

                            <p>As the Bioengineering curriculum and faculty at the University of Washington can at times seem daunting to students, 
                                a clear need in the department was a website by students for students. For my Departmental Honors Project, 
                                my team team sought to address this need by designing a website containing bioengineering course reccomendations and 
                                professor profiles. In doing so, we conducted various surveys to gain the feedback of my peers, interviewed core 
                                faculty members, and effectively displayed information on the website, supported by <i>Wix</i>. Partnering with faculty and 
                                academic advisors, Honors students in the coming year will guide the next iteration of the website to expand the scope of 
                                courses included.

                            <p>Neonatal Asphyxia is extremely common in low resource settings resulting in mortality rates of 68.82 deaths per 100,00
                                as well as long-term disabilities. In an Engineering Design course, myself alongside a team of my peers were able
                                to address this by designing hypothermia inducing cooling cuffs, a portable, cost-effective method to reduce cerebral metabolism
                                inhibit caspase enzymes and suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukins. <i>COMSOL</i> modeling was 
                                completed to ensure the cuffs were capable of inducing hypothermia.

                            <p>Fish are ectotherms that rely on their environment to control their temperature, that is their body temperature varies 
                                directly with water temperature. Thus, heating and temperature control are necessities for many species of aquarium fish.  
                                In my Mass Transport and Systems course at the UW, I developed a PID controlled thermostat using <i>LabView</i> simulations and basic circuitry along 
                                with my peers. The group was able to achieve an extremely accurate controlled with maximum fluctuations from the setpoint within 0.7 degrees C, 
                                by tuning the PID parameters.
